******* tarring files together********
1.to create a tar file(which contains files)
tye: tar -cvf newfilename.tar files      
like: tar -cvf newarchieve.tar f1.txt f2.txt
note: 
tar = trap archive
c=create
v=verbose
f=to write

2. to see the content of tar file without extracting

tye: tar -tvf tarfilename
like: tar -tvf textfile.tar
note:
t= content of tar file

3. to extract tar files
type: tar -xvf filename.tar
like: tar -xvf textfile.tar
note:
x=extract
it will show the content on the bash.if you want to extract file silenly then remove -v(verbose) 
like: tar -xf textfile.tar.
***warning: if tar containg files already exist then it will replace that files with new one

********* compressing file***********

to reduce the size of large files we compress that files to send easily
we have 3 diff command to compress the files

1.gzip, which uses the extension .tar.gz or .tgz
2.bzip2, which uses the extension .tar.bz2
3.compress, which uses the extension .tar.z

note:
In general, 'compress is the fastest', but the resultant files are larger; bzip2 is the slowest,
but the resultant files are the smallest; and gzip falls somewhere in between.
-compress is commonly leat used

1.using gzip(GNU zip)
-to compress the gzip 
type: gzip filename.*   (* means that any file that has same namw will be compress) 

-to uncompres the file
type:gunzip filename.*  (gunzip=G-unzip)

2. using bzip2
-to compress 
type: bzip2 filename.*

-to uncompress 
type:bunzip2 filename.*


3. using compress
-to compress
type: compress filename.*

-to uncompress
type: uncompress filename.*

CREATING BIT-BY-BIT OR PHYSICAL COPIES OF STORAGE DEVICES

command we use
The basic syntax for the dd command is as follows:
'dd if=inputfile of=outputfile'
note:
if=designation of device
of=where the data store(path)

So, if you wanted to make a physical copy of your flash drive, assuming the flash drive is
sdb (we’ll discuss this designation more in Chapter 10), you would enter the following:
 'dd if=/dev/sdb of=/root/flashcopy'

we have different useful commands that we can use with dd command
type: ' dd if=/dev/media of=/root/flashcopy bs=4096 conv:noerror '
note:
bs=block size of data(4kb)
noerror = continue copy data even any error occur
