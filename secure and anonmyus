************ tor browser****************
1. To see what hops a packet might make between you and the destination, you can use
the traceroute command, as shown next. Simply enter traceroute and the destination IP
address or domain, and the command will send out packets to the destination and trace
the route of those packets.

kali > ' traceroute google.com'

2. online router system
“The Onion Router (Tor) Project” in 2002, and it’s now
available to anyone to use for relatively safe and anonymous navigation on the web.
-to be anonymus we use tor broswer to access www and here we can also access dark web


*********proxy server***************

-to be anonymus we also can use proxy server which send our packet using proxyIP not our IP address
we have tool 'proxychain' in linux 

-Kali Linux has an excellent proxying tool called proxychains that you can set up to
obscure your traffic. The syntax for the proxychains command is straightforward, as
shown here:

'proxychains <the command you want proxied> <arguments>'

The arguments you provide might include an IP address. For example, if you wanted to
use proxychains to scan a site with nmap anonymously, you would enter the following:

kali >proxychains nmap -sT - Pn <IP address>

This would send the nmap –sS stealth scan command to the given IP address through a
proxy. The tool then builds the chain of proxies itself, so you don’t have to worry about
it.


we can add our own proxy in etc/proxychain.conf file at the last but if you are using free proxies then its not a good idea 


*****************VPN***************
Some of the best and most popular commercial VPN services, according to CNET, are
the following:
IPVanish
NordVPN
ExpressVPN
CyberGhost
Golden Frog VPN
Hide My Ass (HMA)
Private Internet Access
PureVPN
TorGuard
Buffered VPN

One way to prevent that is to use only VPNs that promise not to store or log
any of this information (and hope they are being truthful). In this way, if someone
insists that the VPN service provider turn over its data on its users, there is no data.



********** encrpted emails***************
One way to prevent eavesdropping on your email is to use encrypted email. 'ProtonMail'
encrypts your email from end to end or browser to browser
This
means that your email is encrypted on ProtonMail servers—even the ProtonMail
administrators can’t read your email.
