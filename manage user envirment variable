1. to see the environment variables type: 'env'

2.to see all variables included shell var,local var,users var etc. we use set command
like: set | more (more to see commands line by line)

3. to see any specific var use grep
like: ' set | grep HISTSIZE ' (HISTSIZE== the max capacity to store our command history default is 1k)

4. to change the var size like : HISTSIZE=0 (now it won't store any command history) we
 remove this when we dont wanna to see our history to others.
  note: it will reset to default value when you leave

5. to make chnages permanently we use 'export' command.but first save the chnages in file
to undo the chnages

like: HISTSIZE=0
      export HISTSIZE
now it is permenet change

to reset simple enter:
HISTSIZE=1000
export HISTSIZE
       
note: to make chnges make sure you first save the default context in any file 
like: echo $HISTSIZE > ~/test.txt   (we use echo $var)

note2:to save all default var content tye:
  '  set > filename '  or set > ~/vardata.txt 

6. chnging in your shell prompt
you shell look like: username@hostname:currenr directory
**you can chnage username and hostname and the directory 
we edit the 'PS1' var which stored this information
****exmaple:
to see "worl'd best hacker: #'
we write: PS1="world's best hacker : # '
than write : export PS1
and to permant chnage we export the var PS1

7. to see your path where the ls,cat and more command exist.when we write ls the system find ls 
in /usr/local/bin or usr/local/sbin directories 
type: echo $PATH

8.to adding in PATH we write: PATH=$PATH:/root/newHackingtool
suppose you download new hacking tool in any particluar directory to use that tool you have 
navigate that directory which is inconvinence to use.. so to use that tool from any directory
we add the path of that tool in our previous path
like : PATH=$PATH:/root/newHackingtool 
****ALter***
make sure you save previous path before any changes. if bymistake you repalce the existing path 
with new one than your commands wouldn't be work anymore like ls,cat etc..


9. user-defind variables... use when you tired to write long commands
   to create just type VarName and your command like this: myNewVar="your are hacked"
10. to remove any var type: unset variableName 
like: unset myNewVar
