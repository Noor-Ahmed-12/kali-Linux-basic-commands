You can find a comprehensive list of third­party modules at PyPI (the Python Package
Index, shown in Figure 17­1) at http://www.pypi.org/.

**Using pip
Python has a package manager specifically for installing and managing Python
packages known as pip (Pip Installs Packages).

command:apt-get install pyhton3-pip

Now, to download modules from PyPI, you can simply enter this:
kali >pip3 install <package name >
note:
When you download these packages, they are automatically placed in the
/usr/local//lib/<python­version>/dist­packages directory

If you aren’t sure where a package
has been placed on your system (sometimes different distributions of Linux use
different directories), you can enter pip3 followed by show and the package name, as
shown here:
kali >pip3 show pysnmp



command:python setup.py install
This will install any unpacked packages that haven’t yet been installed.





Installing Third-Party Modules
To install a third­party module created by another member of the Python community(as opposed to an officially released Python package), you can simply use wget to
download it from wherever it is being stored online, uncompress the module, and then
run the python setup.py install command.
As an example, let’s download and install the Python module for the port­scanning tool
we used in Chapter 8, nmap, from its online repository at https://xael.org.
First, we need to download the module from xael.org:

Here, you can see we use the wget command and the full URL for the package. After the
package has downloaded, you need to uncompress it with tar , as you learned in Chapter

Then change directories to the newly created directory:

Finally, in that directory, install the new module by entering the following:
kali >~/python-nmap-0.3.4 >python setup.py install
running install
running build
running build_py
creating build
­
­­running install_egg_info
writing /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist­packages/python_nmap­0.3.4.egg.info
Innumerable other modules can be obtained this way as well. Once you’ve installed this
nmap module, you can use it in your Python scripts by importing the module. More on
this later. Now let’s get started on some scripting.

**getting start with pyhton
Kali has the IDE 'PyCrust' built in(IDE for python)

PyCharm is
an excellent tool that will help you in your development.



There are many ways to check the builtin functions. One is to look at the official Python documentation available at
https://docs.python.org. Choose the version you are working with and then select
Library Reference.



Hackers use a technique known as banner
grabbing to find out crucial information about what application or service is running
on a port.



We have just created a simple banner­grabbing Python script! We can use this script to
find out what application, version, and operating system are running at that IP address
and port. This gives us key information a hacker needs before attacking a system. This
is essentially what the 'website Shodan.io' does for nearly every IP address on the planet,
and it catalogs and indexes this information for us to search.

                        -------------------------

A banner is what an application presents when someone or something connects to it.
It’s kind of like an application sending a greeting announcing what it is. 
Hackers use a technique known as banner grabbing to find out crucial information 
about what application or service is running on a port.

# to build TCP client connection we need 'socket' model


# we can use this script to find out what application, version, and operating 
system are running at that IP address and port.


""#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# srcipt start here
# we import the socket module,so we can use its functions and tools.
