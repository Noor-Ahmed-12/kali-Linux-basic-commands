1.Basic Wireless Commands

   -ifconfig(which lists each activated network interface on your system along with some basic
statistics, including (most importantly) the IP address of each interface)

	-iwconfig  (If you just want to see your WiFi
interfaces and their statistics, Linux has a specific
command that’s similar to ifconfig but dedicated to wireless.)

	 -If you are not certain which WiFi
	AP you want to connect to, you can see all the
	wireless access points your network card can reach using the iwlist command.
	
	command:iwlist interface action 
	like: iwlist wlan0 scan

	-The nmcli command can be used to view the WiFi
	APs near you and their key data, as
	we did with iwlist, but this command gives us a little more information. We use it in the
	format nmcli dev networktype, where dev is short for devices and the type (in this case) is
	wifi, like so:
	command:nmcli dev wifi

	-addition to displaying the WiFi and connected to API
	APs within range and key data about them,
	including the SSID, the mode, the channel, the rate of transfer, the signal strength, and
	the security protocols enabled on the device, nmcli can be used connect to APs. The
	syntax to connect to an AP is as follows:
	
	command: nmcli dev wifi connect AP-SSID password APpassword
        like:nmcli dev wifi connect Hackers-Arise password 12345678


2.Wi-Fi Recon with aircrack-ng

To use these tools effectively, you first need to put your wireless network card into
monitor mode so that the card can see all the traffic passing its way. Normally, a
network card captures only traffic destined specifically for that card. Monitor mode is
similar to promiscuous mode on wired network cards.
To put your wireless network card in monitor mode, use the airmon-ng command from
the aircrackng
suite. The syntax for this command is simple:
  ' airmonng start|stop|restart interface '

-So, if you want to put your wireless network card (designated wlan0) into monitor
mode, you would enter the following:
kali >airmon-ng start wlan0

wireless passwd creacking which we will learn later 

****************bluetooth device connect and manage*****************
-to scan the get the device info we use 'bluez' tool 

BlueZ has a number of simple tools we can use to manage and scan Bluetooth devices,
including the following:
hciconfig This tool operates very similarly to ifconfig in Linux, but for Bluetooth devices.
As you can see in Listing 141,
I have used it to bring up the Bluetooth interface and
query the device for its specs.
hcitool This inquiry tool can provide us with device name, device ID, device class, and
device clock information, which enables the devices to work synchronously.
hcidump This tool enables us to sniff the Bluetooth communication, meaning we can
capture data sent over the Bluetooth signal.

1.Scanning for a Bluetooth device
type:' hciconfig '

2. to check the device is enable
type: hciconfig hci0 up


scanning bluetooth with 'hcitool'
Scanning for Bluetooth devices in discovery mode
 type: hcitool scan

-Now let’s gather more information about the detected devices with the inquiry function
inq:
kali >hcitool inq

******Scanning for Services with sdptool******
we use service discovery protocol tool.It is also important to note that the
device does not have to be in discovery mode to be scanned

command:sdptool browse MACaddress

shows me using sdptool to search for services on one of the devices detected

example: sdptool browse 76:6E:46:63:72:66
note:
we see that this device supports the ATT
Protocol, which is the Low Energy Attribute Protocol.



**********Seeing Whether the Devices Are Reachable with l2ping****************
Once we’ve gathered the MAC addresses of all nearby devices, we can send out pings to
these devices, whether they’re in discovery mode or not, to see whether they are in
reach. This lets us know whether they are active and within range. To send out a ping,
we use the l2ping command with the following syntax:

commadn: l2ping MACaddress

shows me pinging the Android device discovered in Listing 142.
example: l2ping 76:6E:46:63:72:66 -c 4
