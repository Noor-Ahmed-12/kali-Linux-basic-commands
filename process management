1. to see the current process type: ' ps ' ...
2. to see all process including others users and bg processes type: '  ps aux  '
3.to see the most resource taker process type: '  top  '
top update every 10sec 
4. to search specific command use grep with pipeline like:  ps aux | grep firewall
5. to change the starting process priority type:  nice -n 10 nameofProcess
its raange it -20 to 
+ 19.. and zero as default
6. to chnage the runnnig process priority type: '  renice -10 PID(process ID)..    
it's range is also -20 to 
+19...
 
7. to kill the process we use ' kill ' command with signal switch and PID
like: kill -9 6969    -> 9 is the signal number(absolute kill the process)
comman signals  ->
1. sighub  1  use to restart the process withs same PID
2. sigint  2  use to intrept the process
3. sigquit 3  use to quit the process and save the info in current directoty
4. sigterm 15  use to terminate the process and it is default signal
note:   If you don’t know a process’s PID, you can use the killall command to kill the process.
This command takes the name of the process, instead of the PID, as an argument.
For example, you could terminate a hypothetical zombieprocess like this:
5. to run process in background to save time and use multiprocess 
type: '  & ' in the end of command like:
leafpad newscript & 

6.Moving a Process to the Foreground
If you want to move a process running in the background to the foreground, you can
use the fg (foreground) command. The fg command requires the PID of the process you
want to return to the foreground, as shown next.
kali >fg 1234
If you don’t know the PID, you can use the ps command to find it.
7. scheduling the processes
   it use for future or everyday to any work like scaning or etc to specific time 
   we use two command 1: ' at ' 2: ' crond' ... 
  syntax:  at timeOfexecutaion 
  like :  at none or at 7:20pm so many formats
 time formates: 
      1. at 7:20pm   (on current day 7:20pm)
      2. at 7:20pm June 25 
      3.at noon 
      4. at noon June 25
      5. at tomorrow
      6. at now + 20 minute
      7. at now + 10 hours
      8. at now + 5 days
      9. at now + 3 weeks
      10. at 7:20pm 06/25/2019
it is used in deamon--background 'at' and 'crond ' will discuss in coming chapters
note: 
When you enter the at daemon with the specified time, at goes into interactive mode
and you are greeted with an at> prompt. Here is where you enter the command you
want executed at the specified time:
kali >at 7:20am
at >/root/myscanningscript



SUMMARY
Managing processes in Linux is a key skill for every Linux user and hacker. You must be
able to view, find, kill, prioritize, and schedule processes to manage your Linux instance
optimally. A hacker often will need to find processes on the target they want to kill,
such as the antivirus software or a firewall. They will also need to manage multiple
processes in an attack and prioritize them.
